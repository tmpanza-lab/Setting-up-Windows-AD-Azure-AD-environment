# Setting up Windows AD & Azure AD environment

## Objective

The Windows AD & Azure AD environment Lab project aimed to build and configure a Windows AD and Azure AD environment. The primary focus was to ensures your on-premises Active Directory integrates seamlessly with Azure AD using Azure AD Connect, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, Azure Active Directory and hybrid identity solutions.

### Skills Learned

- Setting up a VMware or Hyper-V lab environment.
- User Account Automation: Test user provisioning and deletion.
- Client Domain Join: Confirming that client PCs apply group policies and DNS resolves internal resources
- Azure AD Sync verifying that on-prem users are visible in Azure AD.
- NAT/PAT and Remote Access: Checking external access through NAT configurations
- DNS and DHCP: Ensuring clients get the right IP and resolve internal domain names.
- File Server Quotas: Confirming that file shares enforce quotas and permissions as configured.
- Automating server configurations and application deployments.
- Managing AD domains, forests, trusts, and group policies.
- Knowledge of Windows Server (2016/2019/2022) and Linux (Kali OS, Ubuntu).
- Proficiency in PowerShell, Bash scripting, and task automation.
- Managing OS-level updates, patches, and security hardening.
- TCP/IP networking, DNS, DHCP, VPNs, FTP, GPO and firewalls

### Tools Used

- Windows Server (2022) for on-prem AD environment.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- PowerShell and Command line interface (CMD) for scripting.
- Administration Tools AD, DHCP, DNS, GPO, FTP and WDS.
- Windows OS (10/11) and Linux (Kali OS, Ubuntu)

## Steps

1. Set Up Your Lab Environment
Use VMware Workstation to create your virtual environment.
• Create VMs:
o VM1 - Windows Server 2022 (for Domain Controller)
o VM2 - Windows 10 (Client machine)

Networking Configuration:
o Set up a custom: Specific virtual network for your VMs to communicate with each other simulating an isolated network environment.

2. Install and Configure Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)

1. Install Windows Server 2022 and configure basic settings:
o Set a static IP address (e.g., 192.168.18.73)
o Assign a hostname (e.g., JHB-SRV29).

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e3fdc87-aeb8-4a13-b599-3182114d926b)

3. Promote the Server to a Domain Controller:
o Set a Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) password.
o Complete the installation, which will automatically reboot the server

4. Automate User Account Management

• Script for Provisioning User Accounts:
o Open PowerShell ISE and write scripts to create user accounts in AD.
• Automate User Provisioning:
# Variables
```
$FirstName = "Thokozane" $LastName = "Mpanza"
$Password = ConvertTo-SecureString "Password123" -AsPlainText -Force
$OU = "OU=Users,DC=mylab,DC=local"
```
# Create user
```
New-ADUser -Name "$FirstName $LastName" -GivenName $FirstName -Surname $LastName -SamAccountName "tmpanza" -UserPrincipalName "tmpanza@mylab.local" - Path $OU -AccountPassword $Password -Enabled $true
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71ce28eb-c8de-4ac0-9c6d-3cae52219483)
Automate Deprovisioning:
o Use Remove-ADUser to remove user accounts:
`Remove-ADUser -Identity "jdoe"'`

5. Join Windows 10 Client to Domain via PowerShell
• Prerequisite: Ensure that the client VM has DNS settings pointing to your Domain Controller's IP (e.g., `192.168.18.73`)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c52d7a2f-93b0-437b-b6fb-bd85fd14b2bf)

• Run this PowerShell command on the Windows 10 client:
`Add-Computer -DomainName "mylab.local" -Credential mylab\Administrator -Restart`
• Replace "Administrator" with the domain admin account, and the client will restart to apply the domain join.
